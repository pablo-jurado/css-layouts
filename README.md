# CSS Layout Homework Assignment

> Due Tuesday, 28 Feb

This homework replaces the Week 2, Lecture 2 homework in Newline.

Create a GitHub repo called `css-layouts`. Include a `.editorconfig` file at the root of the repo.

## Problem #1

Inside a file called `holy-grail.html`, create a [Holy Grail] layout using flexbox that resembles [this image].

**NOTE:** Due to the nature of this problem, there are many examples of this already done on the Internet. Honor system here; do not cheat. This is an example of a "real world" problem.

## Problem #2

Inside a file called `chessboard.html`, create a [chessboard] using HTML and flexbox. For an extra challenge, add some chess pieces on their starting positions. How can you do this semantically?

## Problem #3

Inside a file called `mondrian.html`, create [this painting] using HTML and flexbox.

If you're having trouble creating the whole thing, pick a "chunk" of the painting and work on just that. Then pick another "chunk" and do that, etc. How can you combine your chunks into a single image? (think: HTML tree structure)

**NOTE:** This is a hard problem. Don't stress if you can't get the whole painting done before Tuesday deadline. Just work on as much as you can and be sure to upload your work before lecture.
